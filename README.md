# Note-easy

Do you research a lot by going through plenty of websites and every time you want to note something do you create a google doc and copy paste every time you find a good point. 

With Note-Easy you can do all this in just a couple of clicks. With couple of clicks your notes will be written by Note-Easy in very organised way.

Whenever you see a good point you can just click on "copy to New Google Doc" to copy it to the new document or else you can click on the option "copy to Existing Google doc" to note down the point in the document already created before.

Update: Now we can create a new note with the name you want directly from website itself with a popup opening up when you select "copy to New Google Doc"

Every time you want to note a point that will be started in a new line so that the notes will be organised

I am also looking to update this Extension so that it can be used with all note making apps

Note-Easy is still in development it will be soon released as google Extension
